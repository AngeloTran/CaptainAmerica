    <p>The story behind Thor's hammer is that it was given to him by his father, Odin. The reason most peole cannot lift Thor's hammer is because they are not "worthy". However, there have been few instances where entities or people were able to lift his hammer, Captain America being one of them (in the comics at least).</p>
